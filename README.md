# Resize-Bookmark-Editor

Resize-Bookmark-Editor is an extension for **Waterfox Classic** that is a stripped down version of my version of resize-bookmarks-editor that *only* resizes the bookmark editor window.

Its currently a work in progress!

## Build xpi


### First Time Setup

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org#download).

2. Install GruntJS by typing the following command:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

3. Run the following command in the repository root directory to install all the required grunt plugins: 

```
npm install
```

This setup is required only once.

### Generating xpi
Once all the required grunt plugins are installed, type the following in the repository root directory:

```
grunt
```

A directory named dist would be created and would have the xpi file. The version of extension is obtained from package.json file.
